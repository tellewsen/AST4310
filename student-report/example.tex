\section{Introduction}     \label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The existence of two emission features in the solar spectrum near
12~$\mu$m was announced by
\citetads{1981ApJ...247L..97M}, %% Murcray+others MgI features,
%% adding a brief comment as identifier helps to remember what paper this is
but only when they were informed by L. Testerman and J. Brault that
they had noticed them too.
Before that, \citetads{1980STIN...8031298G} %% Goldman+others IR atlas
had white-pasted them out of their spectrum atlas in the mistaken
belief that all solar and telluric lines should be in absorption.
We explained these emission features many years ago
(\citeads{1992A&A...253..567C}, % Carlsson+Rutten+Shchukina MgI
henceforth Paper~I; see also
\citeads{1994IAUS..154..309R})\footnote{%
Clicking on citations should open the corresponding \acp{ADS} abstract
page in a web browser but you may have to permit web access, for
example for Adobe Reader with the Trust Manager under Preferences. 
Likewise, hovering over an acronym should pop-up its meaning in Adobe
Reader but not with some other pdf viewers.}.

%% Add (Paper I) to the reference
\bibnote{1992A&A...253..567C}{(Paper~I)}

%% Define \PaperI as an ADS clicker
\def\PaperI{\href{http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992A&A...253..567C}{Paper~I}}

%% Note: citations are properly broken by the breaklinks hyperref option
%%   when using dvips, but then do not link in Adobe (Acrobat) Reader.

\section{Model computations}    \label{sec:computations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Background}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the solar photosphere \acp{NLTE} departure diffusion
occurs in the upper reaches of the \MgI\ term structure (see
\PaperI\ for detail).
It is akin to optically-thin collisional-radiative recombination along
Rydberg levels in tenuous plasmas
(Fig.\,\ref{fig:waterfalls})\footnote{%
  Figure production: I usually prepare separate figures, each with
  full axis annotation, and paste these together into multi-panel
  layout using the latex commands in
  \href{http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~rutte101/rrweb/rjr-edu/manuals/student-report/cutmultipanel.tex}{\url{cutmultipanel.tex}}.
  They remove superfluous axis annotation between adjacent panels and
  rescale them to the same size.
  This way I choose the assembly layout while writing the paper.}.

    Collisional-radiative recombination along \MgI\ Rydberg states
    visualized for pool-drop kayakers.
    The lefthand sketch shows that the largest recombination flow from
    the magnesium population reservoir in the \MgII\ ground state is
    into the highest \MgI\ level ($n\!=\!9$ in our model).
%% the ! signs above reduce the spacing around the =    
    The righthand sketch shows that along the $\Delta n\!=\!1$
    downward ladder the flow is initially dominated by collisional
    transitions but that radiative transitions take over.
    The flow is driven by photon losses in strong \MgI\ lines and is
    balanced by radiative ionization in ultraviolet edges.
    Similar Rydberg flows occur in other elements, but the \MgI\
    Rydberg levels have the largest photospheric populations, even
    exceeding the hydrogen ones.

\subsection{Method}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We solved the statistical equilibrium and radiative transfer equations
for all relevant levels and frequencies in \MgI\ and \MgII\ for
various models of the solar atmosphere, including the standard one
formulated in the monumental papers by Vernazza et al.\

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Our computation explained the formation of the enigmatic
\MgI\,12\,$\mu$m emission features.
They arise through population depletion by line photon losses and
population replenishment from the ionic reservoir through highly
excited levels.
A Rydberg-channel replenishment flow is realized by
collisionally-dominated population diffusion via ladder-wise departure
divergence (see Fig.~\ref{fig:waterfalls} in
Sect.~\ref{sec:computations}).
