\section{Stratification of the solar atmosphere}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this exercise we study the radial stratification of the solar atmosphere by using the FALC model by Fontela et al. (1993)

\subsection{FALC density stratification}
The first thing to do is import the data from the modelfiles and make figures of some key quantities.
I start by plotting the total pressure $p_{total}$ against colmn mass $m$. See figures \ref{ptotal} and \ref{ptotal_log}.
We see that they scale linearly. From this we can conclude that we can write 
\begin{equation}
 p_{total} = Cm
\end{equation}
where if one finds $C$ for all pressures and column masses and then find the average $C$, I get $C = g_{surface} = 27398.2$ cm/s$^2$.

% \begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{ptotal.png}
%  \caption{Plot of total pressure against column mass.}
%  \label{ptotal} 
% \end{figure}
% \begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{ptotal_log.png}
%  \caption{Plot of total pressure against column mass using logarithmic scale.}
%  \label{ptotal_log} 
% \end{figure}

Fontena et a. (1993) assumed complete mixing, so we check that this condition holds by plotting the ratio of the hydrogen mass density to the total mass density against height. Next we add the Helium as well and calculate the contribution of helium and hydrogen to the total. From the figure it seems that nearly all of the density is contributed form hydrogen and helium. However if one does the calculation one finds that the average fraction of the remaining elements (the ``metals'') contributes $0.002$ ($0.02 \%$) of the total .This can be seen in figure \ref{Hdensratio_height}
% \begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{Hdensratio_height.png}
%  \caption{Ratio of hydrogen mass density to total mass density vs height.}
%  \label{Hdensratio_height} 
% \end{figure}

Next we plot the column mass against height. See figure \ref{colm_height}. Note that the curve becomes nearly straight if we make the y-axis logarithmic in figure \ref{colm_height_log}. This is caused by XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
% \begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{col_height.png}
%  \caption{Column mass vs height.}
%  \label{colm_height} 
% \end{figure}

% \begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{col_height_log.png}
%  \caption{Column mass vs height with logarithimic y-axis.}
%  \label{colm_height_log} 
% \end{figure}

The next quantity to look at is gas density. Gas density is plottes against height in figure \ref{gdens_height}.

% \begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{gdens_height.png}
%  \caption{Gas density against height with the point where $\rho = \rho_0/e$ marked with a line.}
%  \label{colm_height_log} 
% \end{figure}

We want to know the pressure scale height $H_\rho$ in  
\begin{equation}
 \rho \approx \rho(0)exp(-h/H_{\rho})
\end{equation}

This can be found from the definition
\begin{equation}
 H_\rho = \frac{kT}{M g}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is boltzmanns constant, T is temperature in K, M is the mean molecular weight, and g is surface gravity.
If one assumes that most of the molecules in the photosphere is hydrogen we can set $M=m_H$. Inserting the values for the deep photosphere ($h = -100$) then gives a scale height of $H_\rho = 196.3$ km. This is not realistic. Assuming that the photosphere only contains helium gives a scale height $H_\rho = 49.3 km$. The real number is somewhere between these two, and thus when ones find the mean molecular weight as a function of height later, one should recalculate this number.

Another way to do this is to just mark the point where the density has fallen to $1/e$ of its original value. In figure \ref{gdens_height} this is marked with a line. The point the two lines cross gives $H_\rho \approx 150 $km.


The next step is to compute the gas pressure and plot it against height. We also overplot the product $(n_H + n_e)kT$. See figure \ref{gas_height}. There is some difference between the curves. Plotting the ratio between the curves shows this clearly (figure \ref{gas_height_ratio}). Note however that the sun does not only contain hydrogen. Because of this we must include the hydrogen number density in the ideal gas law. By doing this we obtain figure \ref{gas_height_hel} which shows a curve that seems to be overlapping perfectly. Plotting the ratio between the two curves shows that it deviates only slightly at the fourth decimal place. See figure \ref{gas_height_hel_ratio}. From this we can conclude that the ideal gas law is a very good approximation.

%  \caption{Ratio between gas pressure and ideal gas law when including helium.}
%  \label{gas_height_ratio_hel} 
% \end{figure}

With that done we want to look at the total hydrogen density. We should also include the electron density, proton density, and the density of the electrons that do not result from hydrogen ionization. The electron density, proton density and electron density can be read out of the FALC model. To find the density of the electrons not from ionized hydrogen we need to assume that all of the protons come from ionized hydrogen. This would indicate that $n_H - n_p$ equals the number of neutral hydrogen atoms. And since each neutral hydrogen has one electron this would be the number of electrons still bound to hydrogen, e.g those not from ionized hydrogen. The density of these should then be
\begin{equation}
 n_{be} = (n_H - n_p).
\end{equation}
This is plotted against height in figure \ref{densities_height}. 
% \begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{densities_height.png}
%  \caption{Figure shows densities for a number of quantities against height.}
%  \label{densities_height} 
% \end{figure}
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX EXPLAIN THEIR BEHAVIOUR XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. WHAT DOES THIS IMPLY. WHAY HAPPENS AT LARGER HEIGHT???

With that done plot the ionization fraction of hydrogen against height. See figure \ref{hyd_ion}. Note the logarithmic scale.
% \begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{hyd_ion.png}
%  \caption{Figure shows the ionization fraction of hydrogen depending on height in kilometers.}
%  \label{hyd_ion} 
% \end{figure}
